Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room was a client that had created a successful Android app/game called Draw It or Lose It. They consulted with us to bring it to other platforms, falling within their budget and technical requirements. They needed to be able to run 1000 games simultaneously, with each game running with 4 players (so 4000 clients total) and each game randomly using a randomly picked 8 mb high resolution image.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I felt that I concisely outlined each technical aspect that needed to be covered within the document, succinctly summarizing each complex topic into a digestible and easily understood blurb for each aspect.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Working through a design document was like creating an outline or rough draft of a paper. It makes it easier to roughly come up with the important points that need to be hit, allowing me to make sure I've covered all my bases with broad ideas before I delve into finer details.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  Some of the heavy reading that pertained to the technical aspects of the class started to blur together and some of it went over my head entirely. A mantra I often return to is "you don't know what you don't know". This class illuminated how much I don't know about the technical workings of some of the aspects of operating systems, servers, etc. and made it clear that some of those topics should be revisted in the future. I would improve them by seeking outside sources to better explain some of the concepts in a concise manner so that I may understand the concepts better, to make better technical decisions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  It is always important to consider the user's needs, because if the user doesn't like the software, it is a failure. The software needs to be user-friendly and accomplish all of the things that the user expects of it, otherwise it has not fulfilled its role. It doesn't matter how impressive your code may be from a technical standpoint if the user doesn't have a good experience using the software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  This class reiterated what I have learned from previous classes, which is to outline the broad ideas of what you want to accomplish with the software, and then moving on to the details and how to implement the ideas you have. It is easy to get caught in the weeds of figuring out details of how to make a specific feature work that you have been toiling over for a long time, but making a solid outline and rough draft makes sure that no features are overlooked.
